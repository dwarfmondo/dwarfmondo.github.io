  <h2>Hello</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Matt Vasquez. Nice to meet you. I'm a software developer living in Fort Worth, Texas. Most of my days are spent crafting software and leading development teams.
    <br />
    <b>I love what I do.</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm probably best described as a generalist, and I'm ok with that. I embrace it! It allows me to dip my toe into each layer of an application without being pigeonholed to just the database or front-end. My ultimate goal is to craft awesome software with a balance of form and function. Software that delights. I believe that software is at the intersection of art and science, and that is why I love what I do.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I'm not typing on a keyboard you can find me on the golf course or outside with my wife and two kids enjoying some beautiful Texas weather.

        After trying many Scrum management tools to utilize at previous companies, I found that there wasn’t a product on the market that met all of our needs as an agile development team. I began working on Scrummage in 2008 and continue to work on it today with an awesome team. We have served clients such as Harrisburg University, The Verge, SB Nation and booking.com to name a few.
