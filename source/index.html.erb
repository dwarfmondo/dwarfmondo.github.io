  <h2>Hello</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Matt Vasquez. Nice to meet you. I'm a software developer living in Fort Worth, Texas. Most of my days are spent crafting software and leading development teams. I love what I do.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm probably best described as a generalist, and I'm ok with that. I embrace it! It allows me to dip my toe into each layer of an application without being pigeonholed to just the database or front-end. My ultimate goal is to craft awesome software with a balance of form and function. Software that delights. I believe that software is at the intersection of art and science, and that is why I love what I do.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I'm not typing on a keyboard you can find me on the golf course or outside with my wife and two kids enjoying some beautiful Texas weather.
