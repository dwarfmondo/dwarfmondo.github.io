  <h2>Howdy!</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a software writer living in Fort Worth, Texas. Most of my days are spent designing, creating, and leading engineering teams. I really enjoy what I do. I'm passionate about creating products that delight and promoting a team-centric culture for the companies I serve.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most recently I've been a Scrum Master and Engineering Manager. Ruby is my language of choice, Rails my framework of choice, Backbone my javascript framework of choice and I enjoy designing in Sketch.

We have served clients such as <a href="http://theverge.com">The Verge</a>, <a href="http://sbnation.com">SB Nation</a> and <a href="http://booking.com">Booking.com</a> to name a few.
